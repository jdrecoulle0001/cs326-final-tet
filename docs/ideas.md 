### Innovative Idea:
Our idea is to create a website that provides the user with a live news feed of pressing world issues, and matches that directly to organizations that are helping solve that issue. The goal of this is to consolidate information about different charities, and also provide the direct connection between these charities and their causes.

For example, for the recent Beirut explosion, we would display organizations and petitions that people can support to help aid the survivors. We also plan to create an interactive element where users can track long standing issues they care about, get the latest charity updates, and receive new suggestions and information on systemic issues based on their given interests. We would like to do this by collecting some optional data about the user, such as their location, demographics, and interest in specific social issues.

### Important Components:

Using [Charity Navigator API](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1397) to source charities and non-profits, and all sorts of data about their work. We also plan to use this [News API](https://newsapi.org), along with other APIs for specific news organications (such as [NYT](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)), in order to match current events to charities that are associated with them.
