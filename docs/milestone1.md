part 0: data interactions 

The data interactions are follows - 
1. The user enters their name, email and password which we store 
2. They then pick causes they care about and those preferences are stored 
3. They are then directed to a page which has top 3 trending causes with 3 charities that are helping it below them, and clicking on those will redirect them to an informational page
4. Below this, they can filter by causes to get charities that are helping those issues. The causes they care about will be displayed on top if no filter is selected
